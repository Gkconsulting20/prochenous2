## Setup and Configuration

### Environment
- Python 3.11
- Flask development server running on 0.0.0.0:5000
- SQLite database auto-initializes on first run

### Workflow
- **Flask App**: Runs the main application server on port 5000

### Deployment
- Configured for Replit autoscale deployment (basic setup complete)
- Currently uses Flask development server (NOT production-ready)
- **TODO for Production**: Replace with production WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn, Waitress)

## Recent Changes (October 17, 2025)

### Initial Setup
- Imported project from GitHub
- Configured for Replit environment
- Updated Flask app to bind to 0.0.0.0:5000 for proper port exposure
- Installed Python 3.11 and Flask dependencies
- Initialized SQLite database
- Configured development workflow
- Set up deployment configuration

### New Features Added
- **Geographic Location**: Professionals can now add their location during registration
- **Rating System**: 
  - New "avis" table for storing ratings and reviews
  - Clients can rate professionals (1-5 stars)
  - Average rating and review count displayed on professional listings
  - Professionals sorted by rating (best first)
- **Improved Privacy**: 
  - Display username/pseudo instead of full contact details
  - Email addresses no longer visible in professional listings
- **Enhanced UI**:
  - Location field appears conditionally for professionals during registration
  - Professional cards show location with 📍 icon
  - Rating display with ⭐ icon and review count
  - New rating form (rate.html) for clients to leave reviews

## User Preferences
- Language: French (application interface)
- Database: SQLite (existing choice maintained)

## Notes
- The application uses Flask's development server in debug mode
- **Security Considerations for Production:**
  - Session secret key is currently hardcoded (should use environment variables)
  - Passwords are stored in plain text (should implement hashing with bcrypt or similar)
  - Flask development server is not suitable for production (use Gunicorn/Waitress instead)
